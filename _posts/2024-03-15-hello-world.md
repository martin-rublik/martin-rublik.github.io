As part of my [midlife crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8b88US-6ts)
:grin: I decided to start a blog. I'll be blogging about technical stuff I do or
I like. Nowadays this means mostly:
- Entra ID
- Office 365
- Active Directory, Active Directory Federation Services, Active Directory
  Certificate Services
- OpenID Connect, OAuth, Kerberos, NTLM, LDAP, TLS and other usual suspects
- PKI, X.509 and smart-cards
- :blue_heart: PowerShell

Most of the stuff is not that new and comes from various online sources.
Wherever I have a reference I'll be happy to quote it; still it may be the case
I forgot or didn't know. If you feel you have any relevant feedback do not
hesitate to drop me a message.
