In an Entra ID tenant-to-tenant migration project, we needed to test the
behavior of [Microsoft Network Policy Server
(NPS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/nps/nps-top),
which was used as a RADIUS server to support [MFA for VPN
access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-nps-extension).
We wanted to: 
- understand what it takes to change the NPS MFA adapter configuration, 
- identify the key aspects of this change, and most importantly,
- test it thoroughly before deploying it in production on the day of migration (day-D).

In this post I'll cover, how we approached this task. I'll focus especially on:
- using [freeradius-utils](https://www.freeradius.org/radiusd/man/radclient.html) in [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for testing NPS,
- NPS MFA Adapter configuration/migration aspects.

I'll omit things such as installation and configuration of NPS and WSL. Ping me if you need further info, or check the resources at the bottom. NPS/MFA setup is pretty well documented.

## Installing freeradius-utils
Installing `radclient` is straight forward in Ubuntu (in my case, running in WSL). 

Just execute:

{% include code-button.html %}
```bash
sudo apt-get install freeradius-utils
```

## Initial RADIUS testing with freeradius-utils
To test the NPS configuration, we need:
1. New radius client in your NPS server, generate a secret for the client 
and 

2. Test NPS configuration with a test account using ```radclient``` command. 

The first part is [simple](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/nps/nps-radius-clients-configure) with NPS. It is illustrated by next picture.

![](/assets/pictures/entra-id-MFA-radius/entra-id-radius_client-setup.png)

To test using ```radclient``` command,  we need to setup our variables such as ```USERNAME```, ```PASSWORD``` and shared ```SECRET``` first:

{% include code-button.html %}
```bash
# setup username, password and secret
# beware when copying / pasting into terminal as the commands
# perform a read operation :)
echo "Reading one-time settings"
read -e -p " Provide username: " USERNAME
read -s -e -p " Provide user password: " PASSWORD ; echo
read -s -e -p " Provide shared RADIUS secret: " SECRET ; echo
```

Next, we can test authentication:

{% include code-button.html %}
``` bash
CLIENTIP=`ip a s eth0 | grep -E -o 'inet [0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | cut -d' ' -f2`
echo "Radius Client IP: $CLIENTIP"
echo "Trying to authenticate/authorize $USERNAME"
# authenticate with username/password
echo "User-Name=$USERNAME,User-Password=$PASSWORD,Framed-Protocol=PPP,NAS-IP-Address=$CLIENTIP"  | /usr/bin/radclient -t 60 -x target.server.address:1812 auth "$SECRET"
```

If you are lucky enough, you'll see ```Access-Accept```. This means access was granted.

{% include gimage.html uri="/assets/pictures/entra-id-MFA-radius/entra-id-radius_client-access_accept.png" %}

If you are not so lucky, you'll get ```Access-Reject```, you should
[troubleshoot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/troubleshoot-network-policy-server)
the NPS then.

{% include gimage.html uri="/assets/pictures/entra-id-MFA-radius/entra-id-radius_client-access_reject.png" %}


## Initial NPS MFA Adapter configuration
Initial NPS MFA Adapter configuration is also simple:
1. Download [NpsExtnForAzureMfaInstaller.exe](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54688) from Microsoft site.
2. Run PowerShell script ```AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1``` from ```C:\Program Files\Microsoft\AzureMfa\Config```

This script: 
1. Installs entire Microsoft.Graph PS module :hushed:
2. Asks for ```tenantId``` (or reads it from registry)
3. Generates self-signed certificate that is used for communication / authentication between NPS and the Entra ID tenant
4. Grants necessary permissions on the endpoints called by NPS for authenticating/authorizing users via MFA
5. Updates local configuration so that the new certificate is used in the NPS <=> Entra ID communications
5. Grants permissions to the appropriate private key to ```NETWORK SERVICE```
6. Restarts the NPS service (```ias```)

Typical output of the script is illustrated by next picture.

{% include gimage.html uri="/assets/pictures/entra-id-MFA-radius/entra-id-radius_nps_extension_config.png"%}

## MFA RADIUS testing with freeradius-utils
Once the extension is installed and configured, the NPS server will call Entra ID
for MFA for all NPS clients (e.g. VPN gateways) and *by default* will require MFA
for *all users*.

If you *do not have* OTP authentication method enabled, the authenticator will
prompt you for approve sign-in request (without number matching). After
approval, youâ€™ll receive an ```Access-Accept``` or ```Access-Reject``` response, just like
in previous testing scenarios.

On the other hand, if you have enabled OTP authentication method, you'll need to
authenticate "twice":

1. First, you authenticate with username and password, as in the first case. 
The NPS server will respond with an ```Access-Challenge``` and provides ```State``` parameter.
2. Second, you need to specify the ```OTP``` from the MS Authenticator app along
   with a ```State``` challenge provided by the NPS server to complete the
   authentication.


Following snippet will help you with the testing via ```radclient```.

{% include code-button.html %}
``` bash
# authenticate with username/password, 
# get the State parameter from response
STATE=`echo "User-Name=$USERNAME,User-Password=$PASSWORD,Framed-Protocol=PPP,NAS-IP-Address=$CLIENTIP" | /usr/bin/radclient -t 60 -x target.server.address:1812 auth "$SECRET" | grep State | cut -d = -f 2 | tr -d '[:blank:]'`
# read OTP from authenticator
read -e -p " Provide OTP from MS Authenticator: " OTP
# authenticate with OTP, pass the STATE
echo "User-Name=$USERNAME,User-Password=$OTP,State=$STATE,Framed-Protocol=PPP,NAS-IP-Address=$CLIENTIP" | /usr/bin/radclient -t 60 -x target.server.address:1812 auth "$SECRET" 
```

And the testing is illustrated by next picture.

## NPS MFA Adapter migration considerations and reconfiguration during migration day 
The reconfiguration of the NPS MFA adapter is straightforward. You simply need
to rerun the PowerShell script ```AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1```. During the
process, you'll be prompted to select the new ```tenantId```. The rest of the
setup is simple and easy to follow.

To take advantage of requiring MFA authentication only for users who are MFA
enabled, you must reconfigure NPS server via [registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-nps-extension#prepare-for-users-that-arent-enrolled-for-mfa).

{% include code-button.html %}
``` batch
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureMfa" /v "REQUIRE_USER_MATCH" /t REG_SZ /d "FALSE" /f
```

To revert the configuration either set the value to ```TRUE``` or delete the registry setting.

> :exclamation: WARNING :exclamation: 
>
> Even with ```REQUIRE_USER_MATCH``` set to ```FALSE``` the NPS still queries
> the Entra ID for the user authentication methods. If the user is not found,
> the authentication will fail. Therefore, ensure that all users utilizing the
> NPS/VPN are synchronized with Entra ID.

For users who are not present in Entra ID you'll see these errors:
