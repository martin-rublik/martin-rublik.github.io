Iâ€™ve worked with Entra Connect in various scenarios. As the core component of a Hybrid Identity setup, it offers significant flexibility in its configuration.

In this blog post series, Iâ€™ll cover:
- Part 1: Key components of Entra Connect configuration.
- Part 2: Using AADConnectConfigDocumenter to compare Entra Connect configurations.
- Part 3: Identifying and transferring custom rules across different environments.

# Introduction
You may need to align the configuration of Entra Connect in different scenarios:

- Clean installation and migration scenarios within existing tenant and Active Directory infrastructure:
    - Migrating Entra Connect to a **new** server
    - Setting up a **new** staging [Entra Connect server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sync-staging-server)
- Existing installations and configuration synchronization and scenarios, e.g.:
    - Aligning configurations between existing servers within the same Active
  Directory forest (e.g., aligning staging and active Entra Connect servers).
    - Synchronizing configurations across development, testing, and production environments.

The easiest way to transfer configurations between Entra Connect instances within
the same Active Directory forest is to [export and import the
configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-import-export-config#import-microsoft-entra-connect-settings).

This approach seamlessly transfers the entire configuration from the source
installation to the new installation, with the exception of user accounts
utilized within the Entra Connect setup.

In scenarios where you need to synchronize configuration between existing
deployments or across different Active Directory forests and Entra ID tenants, a
deeper understanding of the components within the Entra Connect configuration is
essential.

Entra Connect (built on Microsoft Identity Manager) has a configuration
comprising several components. 

These configuration components, ranked from most frequently modified to least, include:
1. **Connectors** (management agents) configuration, especially the: 
    - Included Active Directory partitions and respective organization units.
    - Selected attributes and Active Directory schema.
2. **Custom Rules**,
3. other **Entra Connect specific configuration** such as:
    - **Authentication Policy**: e.g. password hash sync, federated, pass-through authentication, etc.,
    - **Identity Mapping Policy**: anchor selection, join rules for users based on email/SID, etc.,
    - **Exchange Online settings**, such as enabling/disabling hybrid mode or public folder support.
4. **Metaverse** configuration, especially the:
    - configuration of custom attributes.

95% of changes I've seen are comprised of **changing organization units in scope**.
4% of changes in configuration affect **custom rules**.

# Connectors configuration
Even though Microsoft Identity Manager allows many changes in connector
configuration, in Entra Connect the configuration options are limited. In
practice you will mostly find following changes useful:
- Active Directory partitions e.g. (child) domains inclusion and exclusion,
- Organizational units inclusions and exclusions,
- Active Directory attributes inclusions,
- Cached Active Directory schema.

Even though you could change these in Synchronization Service Manager directly you
**SHOULD NOT!**. Use Azure AD Connect wizard instead.

To review the current configuration in Active you can either:
- Run Azure AD Connect wizard and review the configuration manually, or
- Use tools to gather this information from backup:
    - official Microsoft: [Azure AD Connect Configuration Documenter](https://github.com/microsoft/AADConnectConfigDocumenter)
    - my unofficial [Azure AD Backup Tools PowerShell module](fixme)

I'll cover the [Azure AD Connect Configuration
Documenter](https://github.com/microsoft/AADConnectConfigDocumenter) in the next
blog post, today I will go briefly through the [Azure AD Backup Tools PowerShell
module](fixme).

To get the module just run
```PowerShell
Install-Module AADC-BackupTools
```
